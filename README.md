# Createless Trains

This addon to Create (create-fabric-0.5.1-j-build.1631+mc1.20.1) was created for the Classic Reintegrated modpack.
It makes trains easier to use without the rest of Create.
Specific Changes:
- Display Boards no longer require power, and are now solid rather than hollow. The internal cogs have been removed. (They still display in ponders, haven't figured out how to remove them there)
- Steam Whistles can be placed anywhere, not just on fluid tanks, and only require redstone power to be activated.
- Train Stations can now manually accept schedules from the player's hand.
- All ponders not related to trains have been removed, and train related ponders have all been edited to remove blocks and text related to other components in Create.
- Seat tooltips have been removed
- The Wrench tooltip now only describes how it interacts with trains.
